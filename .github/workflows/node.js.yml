    # The GitHub token used to authenticate with the GitHub API. This is required when downloading artifacts from a different repository or from a different workflow run. If this is not specified, the action will attempt to download artifacts from the current repository and the current workflow run.

    # The repository owner and the repository name joined together by "/". If github-token is specified, this is the repository that artifacts will be downloaded from.
